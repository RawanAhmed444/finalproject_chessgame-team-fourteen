## About game:
Chess is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of a board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture.‚Äù

### Let's Review the steps of this project
#### first: UML (class Diagram)
Visualization can be a helpful tool to manage some part of a design process.
and show the overall methods and fields
//add uml
#### second :GUI
we use JavaSwing to make the gui of the game.
##### here is the libraries used:
```
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicButtonUI;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
